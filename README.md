# join-stackoverflow-and-softwarerecs

http://stackoverflow.com/ This is well known. Most software developers know this site. It's fun and very usefull.

http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/ This is unknown. Few people write there, low traffic, few questions and answers.

# Imagine you are a new comer

If you are a new comer I can't know in advance which site is the correct one.

You have a use case, but no clue how to solve this.

Maybe you need several hours of coding or you just need to install some magic library `do_magic_for_you`
and you just need a single line of source code to get your use case solved.

Again, if you a new comer you just have a question - no strategy and that's good.
